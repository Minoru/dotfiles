### General settings ###
[general]

# Number of lines that are preserved when ypu go to the next page
context_lines: 0

# Display status line?
status: true

# Screen width. Set to 0 for autodetect
columns: 80

# Center text when screen is wider than 'columns'
center_text: true

# Use default terminal background and foreground colors in place of 'none' (see
# styles below)
use_default_colors: true

# Whether or not to replace fancy Unicode characters (dashes, quotes etc.) with
# their ASCII counterparts. Set this to 'true' if your terminal has troubles
# displaying Unicode.
replace_chars: true

# Your editor of choise
# {byte_offset} and {filename} would be replaced by actual values
# Note that filename is not being escaped, so you should do it yourself (i.e.
# wrap it into double quotes)
editor: vim -c go{byte_offset} "{filename}"

# Interval for autoscroll in seconds
auto_scroll_interval: 3

### Styles ###

# Accepted colors: black, blue, cyan (light greenish blue), green, magenta
# (purpish red), red, white, yellow, none. The latter have different meaning
# depending on the 'use_default_colors' setting: if it's 'true', 'none' would
# mean default setting for that color (i.e., if foreground for some style is
# 'none' and 'use_default_colors' is 'true', fbless would use the same
# foreground color as your terminal uses). If the setting is false, curses
# would use some other colors (possibly grey and black).

### Keys ###

# Alphanumeric keys are denoted by the symbols they produce. The same goes for
# !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, _, -, +, =, / and all kinds of parentheses. The comma
# (,) is an exception: it is used as a delimiter, so when you mean it literally
# (i.e. you want it to be a hotkey for some action) you should type it as
# 'comma' (without quotes).  Backslash (\) should be escaped (i.e., typed twice
# in a row). Other accepted names are: left, right, up, down, enter, backspace,
# tab, home, end, pgup, pgdn.
